# Hi, Iâ€™m Abhishek ðŸ‘‹

**Data Specialist at Forage AI**

---

Iâ€™m driven by a simple philosophy: every challenge is an opportunity to solve a problem and create lasting value.

With a strong background in QA, automation, and operations management, Iâ€™ve helped organizations improve efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making. My work spans:

- **QA Automation** â€“ designing validation frameworks that identify issues early, reduce manual effort, and boost reliability.
- **Data Analytics** â€“ leveraging Excel, SQL, and Power Query to transform raw data into actionable insights.
- **Process Optimization** â€“ streamlining workflows, improving collaboration, and ensuring scalability.

What excites me most is building solutions that make work easier, faster, and smarterâ€”whether through automation, analytics, or simply rethinking how processes should run. At my core, Iâ€™m not just solving problems, Iâ€™m creating systems that prevent them.
